# stamper 0.1.0
a simple package manager made for luau, in luau

## installation
1. clone the repository
2. if you don't have lune installed, install it!!!
3. run `lune run src --help`
4. "enjoy" your stamper experience

## contribution
- make a pr request! i'll probably accept it
- i have no idea how pr requests work but i'll get it eventually

i've tried to make it into an .exe but:
- lune + darklua just didn't work
- zune didn't have half of the required fs functions
- i couldn't find how to get lute process.args
